INSTALL

Extract the archive to a directory.

IN THAT DIRECTORY

Enter the following two commands (in this order)

make
make install

This will install

o the library (libpigpio.a) in /usr/local/lib
o the library (libpigpiod_if.a) in /usr/local/lib
o the header file (pigpio.h) in /usr/local/include
o the header file (pigpiod_if.h) in /usr/local/include
o the daemon (pigpiod) in /usr/local/bin
o the socket interface (pigs) in /usr/local/bin
o the utility pig2vcd in /usr/local/bin
o the Python module pigpio.py

TEST

To test the library do

sudo ./checklib

EXAMPLE CODE

checklib.c, pig2vcd.c, and pigpiod.c
show examples of interfacing with the pigpio library.

pigs.c and pigpio.py show examples of interfacing with the pigpiod daemon.

DAEMON

To launch the daemon do

sudo pigpiod (pigpiod -? for options)

Once the daemon is launched the socket and fifo interfaces will be
available.

When the library starts it locks

/var/run/pigpio.pid

The file should be automatically deleted when the library terminates.

SOCKET INTERFACE

Use pigs for the socket interface (pigs help for help).

FIFO INTERFACE

The fifo interface accepts commands written to /dev/pigpio.

Results are read from /dev/pigout.

Errors are output on /dev/pigerr.

To test the fifo interface perhaps do

cat /dev/pigout &
cat /dev/pigerr &

echo "help" >/dev/pigpio

PYTHON MODULE

The Python pigpio module is installed to the default python location.

You can install it for additional Python versions by

pythonx.y setup.py install

where x.y is the Python version.

If the pigpiod daemon is running you can test the Python module
by entering the following commands.

python

import pigpio

pigpio.start()

print(pigpio.get_current_tick())

print(hex(pigpio.read_bank_1()))

pigpio.stop()

help(pigpio)

quit()

STOP DAEMON

To stop the pigpiod daemon

sudo killall pigpiod

RUNNING ON NON Pi's

You can access the pigpiod daemon running on the Pi from any machine which
can access it over the network.  This access is via the socket interface.

In particular this allows you to use the following on non-Pi's.

o pigs
o the pigpio Python module
o the C socket I/F using libpigpiod_if (header file pigpiod_if.h)

On a Linux machine

make -f MakeRemote clean
make -f MakeRemote
make -f MakeRemote install

This will install

o the library (libpigpiod_if.a) in /usr/local/lib
o the header file (pigpio.h) in /usr/local/include
o the header file (pigpiod_if.h) in /usr/local/include
o the socket interface (pigs) in /usr/local/bin
o the Python module pigpio.py

On Windows machines (and possibly Macs)

The Python module should install with

python setup.py install

pigs and pigpiod_if.c will need minor mods to reflect the
Window's/Mac's socket interface.
